      <p>I was born in New Orleans, but I was raised in Atlanta.I was homeschooled most of my life, I even graduated homeschool. I have always been extremely goofy. 
        I used to think I was going to be the next Tony Hawk. Then my mom said no you are not you can barely walk.
        I used to go back to New Orleans every summer until my grandmother died. My grandmother was a crazy awesome women.
        She could cook any and everything, I remember she would cook my oatmeal from scratch it was the greatest thing I have ever tasted.
        I had another grandmother on my mom's side, now she could make something small into something huge and it didn't matter what it was.
        She was like my best friend I could vent to her about anything. Even though after i was done she would tell me off, but I was cool with it.
        Cause after she was done she would fix me something to eat and she didn't spare any food. 
        Hence why I am Pretty big guy. I was the last person to talk to her before she died. She asked me to sleep with her and keep her company. It was so hard because she taught me how to cook, talk to girls and just how to be myself.
        So I make it a point to always be myself no matter what.
